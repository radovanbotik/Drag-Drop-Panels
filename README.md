# Drag-and-Drop
Based on the list of units I am dynamically creating 2 panels, one for units which is occupied with units, and the other stays blank for units to move into. I am using Drag and Drop API to move units inbetween two panels however I am facing a bug where in order to drop the unit on the empty tile I must first hover over the empty tile. This bug is caused by the design where in order to create and empty tile first I must hover over the area where the tile lies. List is parent element and ouse over event which is responsible for most fo the functionality is tied to this element.
